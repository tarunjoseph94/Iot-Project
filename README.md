# Iot-Project
Greenhouse Management. It collects the temperature, humidity, Soil moisture and light data and send it to the website.
If the temperature is beyond the threshold it turns on the fan.
If the soli is not moist enough it turns on the water pump.
If the plant is not receiving enough light it turns on the bulb.
It uses an Arduino to control the sensors and a node MCU WIFI module to send the data to the website.
The website uses LAMP as its tech stack.
